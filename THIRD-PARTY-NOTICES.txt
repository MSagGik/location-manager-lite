### Third-Party Software Components Used in This Project

Each third-party component is documented below as a structured block with the following rules:
- A block starts with a format heading (`#### Component Name`).
- It is followed by one or more metadata fields, each on a separate line, using the format: `Field Name: Field Value`.
- Blocks are separated by a horizontal rule (`---`) for visual clarity.
- The separator is not part of the data and has no semantic meaning.
